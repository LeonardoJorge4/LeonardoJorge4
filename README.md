### Hello 👋
**I am Leonardo Conrrado Jorge 👨🚀.** I am currently a mobile developer at Elitesoft Informática. I also have experience with web development and a bit of backend.

Currently I work with **React Native** to make mobile apps for Android and iOS.📱

But, I have also used it in projects:
                                                   
🎓 I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development.

I also love UX Design 😍. I like to create beautiful interfaces to give the user a great experience.

I have also worked with PHP, MySQL, Laravel and others. I like project architecture, writing clean code and applying best practices.

The only certainty I have is that learning is a never ending path and I want to stay on it. So I love technology and applying knowledge to solve problems, create solutions and impact lives around the world. ❤️
